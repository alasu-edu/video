Beterbiev vs Bivol 2 live stream: How to watch boxing online today – start time, TV channel, full fight card. Artur Beterbiev vs Dmitry Bivol 2 – aka The Last Crescendo – for the undisputed world light heavyweight title isn't only one of the best pound-for-pound fights of 2025, it's got arguably the highest-quality card this century. Beterbiev won a razor-thin decision when these two met in October, as Bivol seeks revenge

The epic rematch in the light heavyweight division is ready to get underway. Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol are back in Saudi Arabia to slug it out for the undisputed crown at 175 pounds just four months after their epic first meeting.

In what is a really quick turnaround from the first fight last October, Beterbiev snuck a tight majority decision after scorecards of 115-113, 116-112 and 114-114. The 38-year-old came on strong down the stretch, his constant forward pressure doing enough to become the first undisputed light heavyweight champions since the great Roy Jones Jr from 1999 to 2002. The gameplan to cut off the ring worked, but the Russian-Canadian will want to correct a tendency to fall over his front foot for a repeat.

There's the odd boxing sage who still thinks Bivol edged the first fight after a strong start in which he landed the better shots. Though becoming the first fighter to take the unbeaten Beterbiev the distance, Bivol will want to correct walking back in straight lines and a lack of forward pressure that cost him four month ago. A previous victor over Canelo Alvarez, the 34-year-old is desperate for revenge to set up a probable trilogy.

Artur Beterbiev will fight Dmitry Bivol in a rematch for the light heavyweight championship on Saturday, Feb. 22, 2025, at Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Heavyweight champion Daniel Dubois underwent a medical evaluation Thursday, raising doubts about whether he can go ahead with his scheduled IBF title bout against Joseph Parker on Saturday.

Congolese heavyweight Martin Bakole was set to replace Dubois and was “on his way” from the African country, Bakole promoter Ben Shalom told Sky Sports. Dubois’ promoter, however, didn’t confirm that Dubois was a scratch.

Dubois was a no-show at a press conference in the Saudi capital on Thursday, and promoter Frank Warren said it’s because of a medical exam.

“Unfortunately, at this moment in time Daniel is being evaluated by a doctor and when we have more news we will share it with you and update you,” Warren said at the news conference.

Parker said he hopes Dubois will be ready.

“If he is ill, I hope he gets better soon. I’m looking forward to Saturday and putting on a great show,” the New Zealand native said.

The 27-year-old Dubois made his first title defense in September with a brutal fifth-round knockout of Anthony Joshua in front of 96,000 fans at Wembley Stadium.

Though there have been a couple of late changes through a mixture of illness and injury, the Beterbiev vs Bivol card remains one of the best of the 21st century.

After a mystery illness on Thursday meant Daniel Dubois from his IBF world heavyweight title defense against Joseph Parker, the Kiwi will now face contender Martin Bakole for his WBO interim strap.

Unbeaten three-weight world champion Shakur Stevenson is also fighting a new opponent after Floyd Schofield pulled out through an emergency trip to hospital. Stevenson now defends his WBC lightweight title against British fighter Josh Padley, who upset compatriot Mark Chamberlain last time out.

Elsewhere, highly rated middleweight Hamzah Sheeraz gets his first title shot against the relatively inactive WBC champion Carlos Adames, while Joshua Buatsi defends his WBO interim light heavyweight title against fellow Brit Callum Smith. That's a contender for fight of the night.

Both men have scores to settle from the first encounter. Bivol is gunning for revenge, having lost his IBO world light heavyweight belt and his unbeaten record. Beterbiev, on the other hand, claimed the victory and all the belts, but he failed to win by stoppage for the first time in his career And he didn’t convince the boxing world that he was the best.

Today's Beterbiev vs Bivol live stream promises to be a fascinating fight as it sees two of the best light-heavyweights on the planet clash for a second time on a stacked card in Saudi Arabia. Below we have all the info on how to watch Beterbiev vs Bivol from anywhere, with details on worldwide TV channels, broadcasters and start times.

Four months ago, Artur Beterbiev stepped into the ring with a perfect knockout record, having won all 20 of his professional bouts by stoppage. That run came to an end as he was taken the distance by Dmitry Bivol in one of the fights of the year. The 40-year-old may not have got the KO he was looking for but he was awarded the decision and became the first undisputed light-heavyweight champion of the four-belt era.

However, the result was not without controversy as many felt that Bivol had produced the cleaner work and deserved the decision. The 34-year-old showcased his exquisite defence and technique throughout the fight and is now determined to avenge the only blemish on his record. To do so, he will have to produce the perfect performance to not only impress the judges but once again avoid the devastating punching power of Beterbiev.
