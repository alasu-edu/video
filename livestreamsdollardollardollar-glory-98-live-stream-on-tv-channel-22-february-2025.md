The event features a heavyweight superfight between Uku Jürjendal and Jamal Ben Saddik, as well as a welterweight title fight between champion Chico Kwasi and challenger Teodor Hristov.

Jamal Ben Saddik faces Uku Jurjendal in the main event of Glory 98, live from RTM Stage in Rotterdam, the Netherlands on February 22. The pair square off in a three-round international kickboxing bout at heavyweight.

Belgian-Moroccan Jamal Ben Saddik (36-9, 29 KO) steps through the ropes for the first time in two and a half years, since knocking out Benjamin Adegbuyi in a matchup that was overturned to a no-contest after he failed a drug test. Uku Jurjendal (20-9, 16 KO) looks to get back in the win column after suffering a defeat via second-round KO against Levi Rigters last March.

The co-main event is a title bout between Dutch-Surinamese welterweight champion Chico Kwasi (43-5-1, 23 KO) and Teodor Hristov (18-3, 7 KO) from Bulgaria. Also on the card is a light heavyweight battle between Cem Caceres (18-1, 14 KO) of Türkiye and Mory Kromah (31-2-1, 18 KO) of the Netherlands.

In another contest at light heavyweight, Ghanaian-Dutch Michael Boapeah (19-4-1, 7 KO) moves up a weight class, taking on Dutch-Moroccan Ibrahim El Bouni (42-10-1, 22 KO). Morocco’s Iliass Hammouche (34-7, 7 KO) and Bosnian Mesud Selimovic (32-12, 17 KO) go head-to-head at middleweight.
